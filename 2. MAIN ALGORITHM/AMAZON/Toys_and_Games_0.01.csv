Once again, you've created a single use screen that is only useful when running the ""Storm King's Thunder"" adventure. Even despite the fact that it's geared to that adventure path, it's usefulness negligible, at best.

I don't understand why they can't make these DM Screens more useful for these ""kinds of adventures"" rather than solely the specific adventure.  You're supposed to be able to transpose this adventure to other lands outside the Forgotten Realms.  So even just a list of new monsters or NPCs would at least be useful than the map.  Even more would just be stuff related to running the game but broad-use stuff related to giants.

Same thing with Curse of Strahd.  Why not make it useful for raven loft, undead or horror campaigns in general... instead a huge amount of screen space is solely mapping out Castle Ravenloft, which is only useful during a small fraction of the time even for the Curse of Strahd adventure, let alone various other Ravenloft adventuring.

They really kill the extended use of these screens by not thinking about their potential use, both for the adventure in question, as well as use in a broader sense.

The Rage of Demons screen is far more useful for broad under dark adventuring - covering a lot of rules for the various conditions you may suffer... and the map is only one panel.

This Storm Giants one is decent for a few tables it includes - but really misses the mark.  Maybe they should ask a few DMs what they would use?","pretty, but also pretty useless",1473638400,,

I wouldn't advise new DM's to use this by itself.  They should stick to the generic 5e DM screen and just copy/print the other useful information for SKT.
I do like that the information they did put in the screen was relevant to the game and makes accessible some of the frequently visited tables from the adventure book.  I also like the map from the perspective that it contains the page references to the cities and locations. This is pretty useful, especially during Ch 3 of the adventure.
However, there is a very Large amount of wasted space that could easily have been utilized instead of having the whole map take up 2 panels of the screen. The middle of the ocean could have contained info on the Giant hierarchy, the Giant Rune symbols, the Random encounters at Sea table from the DMG, trap tables, or any number of other usefully applicable information to the story.  I would have done away with the Sea portion of the map completely and used that space more efficiently.  In all actuality, the entire map could have been an extra insert, freeing up far more space and making this product far more appealing...or the Adventure book could have included it as a tear out.  There should have been better collaboration on this product.
On a different note, the printing on my copy of the screen was not sized correctly.  The Left and right creases are right over the edge of the words...especially on the Right side.  It is almost illegible when the screen is up and in it's general position at the gaming table.(See attached pic)

These sleights are the 'real work', so it will take a little perseverance. Many of these utility sleights are ones that you ought to know if you want to be a card sleight-of-hand worker.
The instructions are generally clear, but sometimes a detail here and there gets a little confusing. There's a fair number of photos showing how to do many of the sleights.
Sometimes a sleight is a little more complicated than it needs to be. My recommendation is to follow the author's steps in slow-motion with a deck of cards in hand. After you are familiar with the overall effect, you can make adjustments based on what your comfortable with. There may also be other newer methods for learning these sleights if you want to invest in newer card sleight instruction (such as the Daryl Encyclopedia of Card Sleights videos, etc.).
Right now, I'm working on the side steal sleight. He gives a T. Nelson Downs version which has some merit, but it is much more complicated than necessary. The author's own version is a little more do-able. But even the author's method becomes a little too fidgety, so I've made minor modifications to make it work well for me. I start in slow-motion, counting through the substeps to keep pace while I do the move (1..2..3..4). Then I repeat it until I can bring it up to full speed.
If you want to learn sleights for cheap, try this book. You may have to pick and choose through the sleights, and there may be better methods to perform some of these sleights now, but it's not bad for under $10.",Good book,1079395200,,{'Format:': ' Paperback'}

I was surprised to see the face of a handsome teenager, of which my previous impression was COMPLETELY the opposite to the one I held in my hands. And this guy was a professional card magician at the age of 18, and able to do tricks infront of hundreds of people on-stage in 1908!
I have a feeling that this guy's mystery and skill probably gained him significant success with girls his age. The mysterious effects of these difficult to execute sleights are priceless and dazzling beyond belief. If a 3 columns card trick can make girls believe in magic.. then Buckley's stuff probably knocked their socks off... literally! Believe me, this guy would be able to blow David Blaine out of the water and make him look like Bob Longe.
That being said and out of the way, the book itself is amazing. There are very clearcut photos of Buckley's hands and very impressive card tricks, or as he calls them in the fourth section, ""Card Experiments"". Best of all, this book isn't like most others where the authors seem to purposely be vague (S.W. Erdnase) and not give the best descriptions. Mr. Buckley gives you every detail and is your friend throughout the book, showing you exactly how everything is done without any confusion.

There is only one page that doesn't have any stickers and if you are trying to make a robot from the stickers in the books you can only fit one robot in that page.

We thought the small size would be great for their little hands, but If you buy this as an activity book it just doesn't work and I would give it one star because there are no activities in it and your child will need a separate book to put all of the stickers.

If you buy this just for the stickers, they are fun but at $4.00 (current price on Amazon) it doesn't work either, four dollars is a lot of money for these stickers.

It is entirely possible that he/she will be ultimately disappointed (or at least frustrated) that their art won't resemble the professional examples provided considering the minimal directions given.

Four double-sided color pencils (for a total of eight different colors), a black marker (for bolding), speech balloon stencils,  and an eraser are provided.  The problem here is that it really becomes more practice in tracing than actually learning how to draw.  Each exercise is four steps: 1. a stick figure; 2. the pipes 3. details; and 4. ""detailed"" details.  There aren't any transitional instructions on how to actually get from Step 1 to the final image; it is just a visual demonstration.  This book is best for those amateurs with some basic art class experience in terms of knowing how to draw details once they've have made the circles and connecting lines.

This book is the perfect skill level for someone like me.  I mostly can copy things right now, but if I draw something from memory, my lack of skill is apparent. That was my motivation behind buying this book.  I needed to build on my skills and this book looked like the perfect thing to help with that.

The book starts out with having you trace some pictures just to get your hand and eye used to drawing different lines.  I have to say that this may have been one of the most interesting pieces of advice that I have learned from this book so far.  I would have never even considered tracing something in the past, but now I want to go buy some tracing paper and try a little more tracing.

As you move through the lessons they become more difficult.  After tracing, you work on stick figure frames for the characters, next you practice ""piping"" which is where you draw guides for the outside lines, and then finally you move on to the detailing that really makes your drawings come alive.

The book is set up so that you can draw in the book itself.  This is a great idea as well, but this is also where I ran into my issues with the book.

1. It's too small.

At 8.5 x 8.6 inches the book isn't even as big as a standard piece of paper.  It's tough to practice drawing details when you don't have much room to fit those details into.

2. The book doesn't lay flat

The book has a traditional binding so the pages have and arch to them when you try to lay it out flat to draw in it.  You need to press down on the pages to flatten them and even then there is still a little curve to them.  It makes it tough to draw straight lines at times and since I, and the target audience of this book, aren't that great of artists at this point, it really makes it frustrating to do some of the lessons.

If this book had spiral binding, like a notebook, and was larger I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.  As it stand now, it's 4 stars for me.  I am still glad I bought it because I really feel like it gave me some good things to practice.",Good for beginners,1352851200,,{'Format:': ' Paperback'}

This is definitely a craft that needs adult assistance. Even for a bit older kids (9-10) who might be able to handle all the instructions on their own, there are parts where it's just easier to have a second person to help interpret the directions as the other person does the steps. I helped make the first puppy-- we figured out the directions for making the pom-poms without too much difficulty. Getting it the right shape can take a bit of trial-and-error, but it ends up looking fine even if the ""legs"" aren't as distinct, etc. The puppies are not a super sturdy toy, since they are glued together, but are cute for gently play or as decorations.

So here's my review on the logistics:  It was quite time consuming for the grooming, styling and getting the shaping right. Trimming the pom poms can get messy. Expect a pile of yarn fur everywhere. Make sure you have comfortable scissors - cutting the yarn down the middle when making the pom pom definitely required some elbow grease. Tuck the eyes as deep as possible into the fur, or else the puppy will look bugged eye. Also, I scanned the paper punch-outs of accessories to print for future use so I won't ""run out."" There's not enough yarn to make all the pups, the white yarn included in the kit was exactly enough to make one pomeranian.

Pros:
The book provides detailed directions for seven different dog breeds in addition to abbreviated suggestions for how to create an unlimited number of breeds on your own.
Book directions are clear and detailed with large, accurate pictures.
The pompom maker is sturdy and easy to use. I had no problem creating pompoms easily my first try.
The kit comes with enough basic supplies to make four adorable puppies, provided you take yarn measurements into account
I was very satisfied with how cute my puppies turned out!

Cons:
The basic school glue provided was not strong enough to hold the heads to the bodies or the felt ears to the heads.
The punch-out dog carriers were too small for all of my pups.
The kit is probably a bit too challenging for most eight-year-olds. I'd recommend it for ages ten and up.
While there is enough yarn provided to make four dogs, there is not enough to make any four you want. Some dogs require too much yarn if you want to create four dogs total.
The measuring tape on the back of the book measures in inches and centimeters, while the book directions are in yards.

Suggestions:
Use a hot glue gun to hold the dog together. I used superglue, but my puppies are a little fragile.
Take yarn measurements into account when choosing pups or just buy more yarn at a craft store.
If you wrap the yarn around the height of the book, you'll have half a yard of yarn. Use this cheat mentioned in the book instead of the confusing ruler.
When the book says to cut the yarn short, be sure to cut it quite short or your pup might look a little messy and shaggy.

There is not enough yarn to do any animal that's one color only. That's a mistake on the part of the makers since the multi-colored pets are a little harder to make. The Pomeranian pup had black yarn at the back of her head in the pic I attached.

One weird part too is when you finally start to cut the yarn the instructions indicate something like ""you might find the yarn falls to the middle when you are cutting...don't worry! it won't fall out"" when in fact OH HECK YEAH its gonna fall out...unless you position your other hand to hold the middle of the donut appliance firmly to hold the shreds in place.

I recently purchased the 4M Fairyland Dollies kit which was awesome and the fairies came out adorable. I thought this would be similar but it was a joke. I had no problem making the pom-poms but once you get into having to cut the pom-poms to shape them into dogs it becomes pretty much impossible and the mess is out of control. If you can get anywhere close to having your pom-poms look like dogs you then have to glue all of the features on with the tiny little glue tube they give you and it just a useless sticky mess. To make matters worse the little accessories are made out of thin cheap paper - how this could be marketed as something a child could either make or play with is beyond me.

Although I love crafts I'm not that great at them, so I was delighted with this result. This is the first project I have ever done where the finished product looked as good as the picture - and on the first try!

The book gives really straight-forward, easy-to-follow instructions. They show you how to make dogs that look like the real breed! We have made 6 dogs now, from the easiest to the most complicated in the book, and they're all great.

My daughter wraps the pom pom and cuts the pom pom. I do the tying. She cuts out the ear shapes, and decides which decorations to use. For a 5-year old, she can be quite involved, but she definitely needs my help. It's a really fun project to do together.

One thing: the glue in the kit is actually pretty good, but you'll still have to hold pieces on and wait for things to dry. We have a little hot glue gun, and this has made the process easier and probably helps keep the dogs holding together better. My daughter is playing with the ones we made and sleeping with them and they hold up like regular stuffed animals!

We made 4 dogs with the kit supplies, then promptly went to the craft store to buy more supplies to make more pups! We bought a bunch of different thick yarn types and they all worked well and gave different effects! Once you get the hang of it you can get creative too. You could easily make cats, rabbits, a turkey - whatever you want that you can imagine doing with pom pom shapes.

Pros:
Great, easy directions
Nice supplies in the kit
Variety - you can make so many types of dogs!
Fun project to do with your kids
The finished product is super cute and kids will love them like real stuffed animals
Kids could make these as gifts for their friends, or even ornaments for relatives
Lots of room for creativity
You can keep making dogs forever by buying supplies at the craft store
Price - you get to make 4 dogs, which equals out to less than what you'd pay if you bought a similar pre-made dog at the store
Amazon price- I bought this in a store and paid 20 bucks so the price here is great

I even have trouble holding them.  The cards are repetitive and when the client comments about this, we have a discussion about how we sometimes get angry about the same thing so the cards are giving us the chance to come up with many ways to handle the same situation. I also use the cards with the parents and children.  This has been very valuable when the children see their parents admit their behavior is not always appropriate and they are working on their own anger.  I have combined this game with deep breathing.  They are getting rid of the ""Dragon's Breath"" as they exhale.

I felt each section was too long to read. Also sometimes with rhyming stories the sentence construction is awkward for kids to understand since it is worded to allow for phrases to rhyme.  I could see that in a family setting one could read it and stop to talk about it. I'm very experienced as a story teller so I used each part of the egg to tell the story myself with children supplying facts from their own knowledge. I also made a strip of paper for each child with 8 eggs each smaller than the first and labeled with the days of the week and one word for each day. Sunday- Praise God and children put a palm leaf sticker on the egg, Monday- Respect God, children used a glue stick to add a small picture of the temple I had printed form clip art, Tuesday Love like Jesus did, a heart sticker, Wednesday- offer your best, rubbed a spice scent lip balm on it, Thursday- Remember Jesus added a small clip art picture of the last supper, Friday- Forgiven a cross sticker and for Saturday and Sunday the phrase Jesus rose from the dead. The Saturday egg children colored gray and Sunday left blank. At first the eggs were very hard to take apart.

We've had the bakery one for over a year, and although we've lost many of the magnets, she returns to it all the time.

One thing I will say - having had the cupcake one for a while - the box did eventually dent, and with both of the sets, I've found it a little frustrating trying to get the cards out of the box (as they stick in there really well)... my daughter is actually better at removing them than I am (!!!), and I'll note the company who made it was very thoughtful in scalloping the bottom to make it easier.  The magnets are pretty strong.

However, I would want to make sure that anyone who doesn't already own this great game is aware that the game itself is a lot of fun and there are many variations/rules variants that can also keep it fresh for long time players. If you haven't tried partnership Acquire, give it a try, it's a whole different game.

For those not familiar with the game, there are tiles that are placed on the game board. When two or more are joined, they form a hotel chain. Only 6 hotel chains can exist on the board at a time, so certain tiles can become unplayable for a period of time. When a tile is played that connects two hotels, they are merged with the longer chain taking over the smaller. If they are the same size, the person playing the merging tile determines which chain takes over.

The subtleties of the game make it one of the true gems of boardgames. Sid Sackson developed the original version about 50 years ago and hundreds, if not thousands, of games have been developed since that in same ways have employed some of the mechanics and strategic elements of this game. Each player has unique information about the future growth of the hotels and the upcoming mergers. They can each take advantage of this but of course, other players can observe what they do and infer what information they have...

The board itself is pretty boring and I thought I would like it or it would be too math oriented because of the buying and selling of stock but that's not the case! It is actually really easy in that regard. And it's surprisingly satisfying matching up your square to the letter/number spot on the board. Not very complicated game play but still played well.

Overall, a decent game. I would say it's not a regular in our game play but we do bust it out on nights when we don't want such an intense game or when we may have gaming newbies for its simple play.

Sound dry? Well, it is a little dry. But it does tell a pretty good story. It is fun to see a little startup company grow into a giant that gobbles up its rivals. There is also a neat mechanic at work where the game doesn't end until a player formally announces that the end conditions have been met, by either announcing that four companies are a set size of tiles, or one company has become too big.

I understand the rating is lower because previous versions of this had a higher quality of components. To me the component quality is alright for the $30 price tag, and overlooked in these complaints is the quality of the stock cards which are of good print. I honestly would not pay for a more expensive version of this game because while I enjoy playing it as a basic game of economics, there are a few problems. The tile draws can be quite random, there is no player elimination but a bad bet early on can eliminate a player from making meaningful plays due to him/her having his money tied up in a company that doesn't get bought out.

Here, your success is partially based on the luck of the tiles you draw, but after that, strategy takes over. Do you invest in other players' hotels, or only your own? Do you choose to merge with another hotel, or just grow on your own? Do you risk building a hotel so large that no one can buy you out? Because that's how you make money!

I love this game, but my husband won't play it anymore, and I see his point. All 3 times we've played it, he's gotten stuck in the same trap. He formed hotels and bought stock in the early game, until he ran out of starter cash. After that, he didn't draw the right tiles to connect his hotels with anyone else's. So, his hotels never merged, and he never made any more money. Which means he couldn't buy stock in anyone else's hotels. He essentially sat there watching everyone else play, without cash, waiting for the lucky connecting tiles that never came. He acknowledges he probably just had terrible luck, and that scenario probably wouldn't happen again. I wish there were a mid-game rescue rule to help bail out players who find themselves in this position.

I still love this game! I know lots of reviewers are attached to the old-style gameboard in which the tiles slotted in place. I've never played the old style, but the cardboard tiles and board in this edition work just fine. They aren't finely crafted as Scrabble wooden tiles, but they get the job done. I will agree, the cardboard trays in which you keep your tiles are pretty flimsy.

Background: Remake of the game from the 1960's by 3M of the same name. The object of the game is to profit by connecting two or more squares to form a hotel. If two (or more) hotels end up touching, they merge, with the larger hotel (the one with the most squares) acquiring the smaller one. Money is made by buying shares in hotels and having them grow. Bonuses are paid out to the majority and minority shareholders, and the process is repeated until the squares are all used, or no legal moves are left.

Great strategy game with a enough chance built in to frustrate the best-laid plans. (Invest in large hotels and be cash-poor, or invest in small hotels and hope for a pay-day--lots of ways to play).

Don't let words like finance, shareholders, stock, or merger scare you away. The game is so easy, my six year-old daughter is able to play (with help)--and do well! A great, original game. My friends (who aren't finance majors) love it.

Only four stars due to cardboard construction, and smooth board (which allows pieces to ""meander""--your OCD friends may go nuts). The older versions of this game had a raised grid to keep pieces in place.","Excellent, simple, original game",1451088000,,

The level of difficulty for this board game is pretty low - learning the gameplay is much closer to Dominion or Ticket to Ride vs. Agricola or Puerto Rico.  It's a great game everyone in the family can get into.  We also play it to take a break in between Agricola games :)

We've played it a few dozen times and it has great replay value.  It's a more entertaining version of Monopoly.  It's a turn based game, where each player places a tile on their turn that triggers a certain action in the game - adding to an existing empire, merging two companies together, or reinforcing a company's position.  Lots of fun - highly recommended if you're looking for another game!",Love this board game,1437004800,,

The only downside is that when I played it was with a large group of six which led to lengthy turns and some people losing interest all together.
